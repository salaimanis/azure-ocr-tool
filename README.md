## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/azure-ocr-tool.git
cd azure-ocr-tool
```

### 2. Create and Activate Conda Environment (Recommended)  
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate azure-ocr-tool
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Setup

### 1. Create Azure Cognitive Services Resource  
- Go to the Azure Portal: https://portal.azure.com/  
- Create a new **Cognitive Services** resource  
- Choose **Document Intelligence (Form Recognizer)** as the service  

### 2. Retrieve API Key and Endpoint  
- After creation, go to **Keys and Endpoint** section  
- Note down:  
  - **API Key** (Key 1 or 2)  
  - **Endpoint URL**

### 3. Configure Credentials  
- Create a `.streamlit` folder in the root of your project  
- Inside it, create a file named `secrets.toml` and add your credentials:

```toml
[azure]
AZURE_ENDPOINT = "your_azure_endpoint"
AZURE_KEY = "your_azure_key"
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure `.streamlit/secrets.toml` is in the same directory as your `ocr_gui_app.py`

## üöÄ Running the Application

### 1. Launch the App  
```bash
streamlit run ocr_gui_app.py
```

### 2. Open the App  
- The browser should open automatically  
- If not, open: http://localhost:8501

## üñºÔ∏è How to Use

1. Upload an image file (JPG, JPEG, or PNG)
2. Select the output format: Text, Word, PDF, or Excel
3. Choose OCR model: 
   - `prebuilt-document` ‚Üí Structured (tables, forms)
   - `prebuilt-read` ‚Üí Simple text or handwriting
4. Click **Extract Text**
5. View the results and download the output file

## ‚úÖ To Do

* **Enhance Table Recognition:** Improve the accuracy and formatting of extracted tables to better represent the original structure. This could involve:
    * Identifying complex table layouts with merged cells or varying row/column spans.
    * Providing options for outputting tables in structured formats like CSV or Markdown.
    * Allowing users to define table regions manually for more precise extraction.
* **Refine Text Formatting:** Implement features to better preserve the original formatting of the extracted text, such as:
    * Recognizing and maintaining paragraph breaks.
    * Identifying and applying basic text styles (bold, italics, underlines).
    * Handling text orientation and multi-column layouts more effectively.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

* **Azure Free Tier Constraints:** As mentioned earlier, the Azure free tier for Document Intelligence has usage limits.
* **Complexity of Images:** The accuracy of text and table extraction can be affected by the quality, resolution, and complexity of the input images. Images with significant noise, skew, or poor lighting may yield less accurate results.
